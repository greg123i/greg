description: rules for making literally any piece of code or folder ever
alwaysApply: true

 - dont make any spaghetti code: if its unreadable, rewrite it until it is, else, anyone can grab a fork and eat it like actual spaghetti
 
 - make code you and i can understand: dont use list comprehensions, one-liners, shortened variables, terrible function and names, etc, this will result in a mess
 
 - have comments: add comments to explain code and describe how functions, classes or files work or its purpose, if there arent any, add those before you get a 100% chance of having a traceback, crash or a mess
 
 - have short functions, methods and classes: make them at most 50 lines, 100 lines for classes, else, shorten them or split them up
 
 - make files short: keep them 500 lines or less, else, shorten it or make them multiple files so no god file will mess up everything via having bugs u cant look for
 
 - if you cant fix code using this, refer to the guso.md file
