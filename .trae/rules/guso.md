how to do guso:
 
 1. describe the error or behavior in detail, copy-paasting tracebacks works fine
 2. make or remake a plan on how to possibly fix it
 3. try to fix it via said plan
 4. if it works, skip the next steps, else, go to #5
 5. go to #2, if u cant fix it via steps #2 to #5 for the 3rd time, go to #6
 6. start over from #1, if that doesnt work for the 2nd time, go to #7
 7. search the problem up on google or stack overflow then try to fix it, if u still cant fix it, go to #8
 8. give up and tell you cant fix it
